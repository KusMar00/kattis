## Notes
The `update_readme.py` script requires a relatively strict file structure and naming convention in order to work: Problems are found in the `solutions/` dir. The title of a problem is determined by the subdirs in `solutions/`. Each subdir has a list of solution files. The name of these files must correspond to the name in the kattis problem url. For instance a solution to the *Knight Packing* problem, must be called `knightpacking.cpp`.

Credits must be given to [this repo](https://github.com/robertusbagaskara/kattis-solutions/tree/master), for inspiration on the script.
